AI Powered Virtual Assistant in Python

This project is an AI powered virtual assistant built using Python. The assistant can interact with users, understand their questions, and provide intelligent responses using an AI language model. It works like a basic chatbot assistant that can answer questions and hold conversations.

The project helps in understanding how AI models, APIs, and conversational systems work together in real applications.

Project Description

The virtual assistant takes user input, sends it to an AI model using an API, and receives a meaningful response. The assistant maintains conversation history so it can respond in a contextual manner. This project focuses on building a conversational AI assistant using Python.

The assistant runs in the terminal and can be extended later to support voice input and output.

Features of the Assistant

The assistant can answer user questions
It supports conversational interaction
It uses an AI model for intelligent responses
It maintains chat history
It works in real time

Technologies Used

Python programming language
OpenAI API for AI responses
Basic natural language processing
API integration

Project Structure

main.py
README.md

How to Run the Project

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Install the required library using
pip install openai

Open the main.py file and add your OpenAI API key.

Run the program using
python main.py

Start typing your questions and the assistant will respond.

How the Assistant Works

The program starts the assistant and waits for user input.
User input is sent to the AI model using an API call.
The AI model processes the input and generates a response.
The response is displayed to the user.
The conversation history is stored for better interaction.

The main logic of the assistant is implemented in the main.py file
